## Requirements ##

## Building ##

Building should be straightforward. Open DrawQuest.xcodeproj and build normally.

## Known Issues ##

The drawing editor is buggy, probably due to changes in iOS 8 and iOS 9.

Without access to a DrawQuest server, much of the app has not been tested, but one can
launch the app in the iPhone simulator and get through the first time experience to get
to the main tabs.

Most of the warnings have been dealt with, but some remain, but hopefully nothing serious.

The app uses a horribly old version of the Facebook framework, but updating it to the
currently set of Frameworks would be a lot of work so this has not been done.
