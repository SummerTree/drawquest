/**
 * Welcome to YapDatabase!
 *
 * The project page has a wealth of documentation if you have any questions.
 * https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase
 *
 * If you're new to the project you may want to visit the wiki.
 * https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase/wiki
 * 
 * The YapDatabase class is the top level class used to initialize the database.
 * It largely represents the immutable aspects of the database such as:
 *
 * - the filepath of the sqlite file
 * - the serializer and deserializer (for turning objects into data blobs, and back into objects again)
 *
 * To access or modify the database you create one or more connections to it.
 * Connections are thread-safe, and you can spawn multiple connections in order to achieve
 * concurrent access to the database from multiple threads.
 * You can even read from the database while writing to it from another connection on another thread.

/**
 * How does YapDatabase store my objects to disk?
 *
 * That question is answered extensively in the wiki article "Storing Objects":
 * https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase/wiki/Storing-Objects
 *
 * Here's the intro from the wiki article:
 *
 * > In order to store an object to disk (via YapDatabase or any other protocol) you need some way of
 * > serializing the object. That is, convert the object into a big blob of bytes. And then, to get your
 * > object back from the disk you deserialize it (convert big blob of bytes back into object form).
 * >
 * > With YapDatabase, you can choose the default serialization/deserialization process,
 * > or you can customize it and use your own routines.
 * 
 * In order to support adding objects to the database, serializers and deserializers are used.
 * The serializer and deserializer are just simple blocks that you can optionally configure.
 * The default serializer/deserializer uses NSCoding, so they are as simple and fast:
 *
 * defaultSerializer = ^(NSString *key, id object){
 *     return [NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:object];
 * };
 * defaultDeserializer = ^(NSString *key, NSData *data) {
 *     return [NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithData:data];
 * };
 * 
 * If you use the initWithPath initializer, the default serializer/deserializer (above) are used.
 * Thus to store objects in the database, the objects need only support the NSCoding protocol.
 * You may optionally use a custom serializer/deserializer for the objects and/or metadata.
