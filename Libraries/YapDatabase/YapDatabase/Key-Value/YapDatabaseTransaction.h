/**
 * Welcome to YapDatabase!
 *
 * The project page has a wealth of documentation if you have any questions.
 * https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase
 *
 * If you're new to the project you may want to visit the wiki.
 * https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase/wiki
 * 
 * Transactions represent atomic access to a database.
 * There are two types of transactions:
 * - Read-Only transactions
 * - Read-Write transactions
 * 
 * Once a transaction is started, all data access within the transaction from that point forward until completion
 * represents an atomic "snapshot" of the current state of the database. For example, if a read-write operation
 * occurs in parallel with a read-only transaction, the read-only transaction won't see the changes made by
 * the read-write operation. But once the read-write operation completes, all transactions started from that point
 * forward will see the changes.
 * 
 * You first create and configure a YapDatabase instance.
 * Then you can spawn one or more connections to the database file.
 * Each connection allows you to execute transactions in a serial fashion.
 * For concurrent access, you can create multiple connections,
 * and execute transactions on each connection simulataneously.
 * 
 * Concurrency is straight-forward. Here are the rules:
 * 
 * - You can have multiple connections.
 * - Every connection is thread-safe.
 * - You can have multiple read-only transactions simultaneously without blocking.
 *   (Each simultaneous transaction would be going through a separate connection.)
 * - You can have multiple read-only transactions and a single read-write transaction simultaneously without blocking.
 *   (Each simultaneous transaction would be going through a separate connection.)
 * - There can only be a single transaction per connection at a time.
 *   (Transactions go through a per-connection serial queue.)
 * - There can only be a single read-write transaction at a time.
 *   (Read-write transactions go through a per-database serial queue.)

/**
 * A YapDatabaseReadTransaction encompasses a single read-only database transaction.
 * You can execute multiple operations within a single transaction.
 * 
 * A transaction allows you to safely access the database as needed in a thread-safe and optimized manner.

@interface YapDatabaseReadTransaction : YapAbstractDatabaseTransaction

/**
 * Transactions are light-weight objects created by connections.
 *
 * Connections are the parent objects of transactions.
 * Connections own the transaction objects.
 *
 * Transactions store nearly all their state in the parent connection object.
 * This reduces the memory requirements for transactions objects,
 * and reduces the overhead associated in creating them.
