 * If you're new to the project you may want to visit the wiki.
 * https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase/wiki
 * 
 * This is the base class which is shared by YapDatabaseConnection and YapCollectionsDatabaseConnection.
 *
 * - YapDatabase = Key/Value
 * - YapCollectionsDatabase = Collection/Key/Value
 * 
 * From a single YapDatabase (or YapCollectionsDatabase) instance you can create multiple connections.
 * Each connection is thread-safe and may be used concurrently.
 *
 * YapAbstractDatabaseConnection provides the generic implementation of a database connection such as:
 * - common properties
 * - common initializers
 * - common setup code
 * - stub methods which are overriden by subclasses
 * 
 * @see YapDatabaseConnection.h
 * @see YapCollectionsDatabaseConnection.h

 *
 * By default the objectCache is enabled and has a limit of 250.
 *
 * You can configure the objectCache at any time, including within readBlocks or readWriteBlocks.
 * To disable the object cache entirely, set objectCacheEnabled to NO.
 * To use an inifinite cache size, set the objectCacheLimit to zero.

#pragma mark State

/**
 * The snapshot number is the internal synchronization state primitive for the connection.
 * Although it sometimes comes in handy (in a pinch), or for general debugging of your app.
 *
 * The snapshot is a simple 64-bit number that gets incremented upon every readwrite transaction
 * that makes modifications to the database. Due to the concurrent architecture of YapDatabase,
 * there may be multiple concurrent connections that are inspecting the database at similar times,
 * yet they are looking at slightly different "snapshots" of the database.
 * 
 * The snapshot number may thus be inspected to determine (in a general fashion) what state the connection
 * is in compared with other connections.
 * 
 * You may also query YapAbstractDatabase.snapshot to determine the most up-to-date snapshot among all connections.
 *
 * Example:
 * 
 * YapDatabase *database = [[YapDatabase alloc] init...];
 * database.snapshot; // returns zero
 *
 * YapDatabaseConnection *connection1 = [database newConnection];
 * YapDatabaseConnection *connection2 = [database newConnection];
 * 
 * connection1.snapshot; // returns zero
 * connection2.snapshot; // returns zero
 * 
 * [connection1 readWriteWithBlock:^(YapDatabaseReadWriteTransaction *transaction){
 *     [transaction setObject:objectA forKey:keyA];
 * }];
 * 
 * database.snapshot;    // returns 1
 * connection1.snapshot; // returns 1
 * connection2.snapshot; // returns 1
 * 
 * [connection1 asyncReadWriteWithBlock:^(YapDatabaseReadWriteTransaction *transaction){
 *     [transaction setObject:objectB forKey:keyB];
 *     [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:1.0]; // sleep for 1 second
 *     
 *     connection1.snapshot; // returns 1 (we know it will turn into 2 once the transaction completes)
 * } completion:^{
 *     
 *     connection1.snapshot; // returns 2
 * }];
 * 
 * [connection2 asyncReadWithBlock:^(YapDatabaseReadTransaction *transaction){
 *     [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:5.0]; // sleep for 5 seconds
 * 
 *     connection2.snapshot; // returns 1. See why?
 * }];
 *
 * It's because connection2 started its transaction when the database was in snapshot 1.
 * Thus, for the duration of its transaction, the database remains in that state.
 * 
 * However, once connection2 completes its transaction, it will automatically update itself to snapshot 2.
 *
 * In general, the snapshot is primarily for internal use.
 * However, it may come in handy for some tricky edge-case bugs, or for general debugging.

#pragma mark Long-Lived Transactions

/**
 * Invoke this method to start a long-lived read-only transaction.
 * This allows you to effectively create a stable state for the connection.
 * This is most often used for connections that service the main thread for UI data.

 * This will implicitly end the long-lived read-only transaction. Oops.
 *
 * This is a bug waiting to happen.
 * And when it does happen, it will be one of those bugs that's nearly impossible to reproduce.
