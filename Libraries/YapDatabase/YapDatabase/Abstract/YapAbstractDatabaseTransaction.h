 * Welcome to YapDatabase!

 *
 * This is the base database class which is shared by YapDatabaseTransaction and YapCollectionsDatabaseTransaction.
 *
 * - YapDatabase = Key/Value
 * - YapCollectionsDatabase = Collection/Key/Value
 *
 * YapAbstractDatabaseTransaction provides the generic implementation of a transaction.

/**
 * Transactions are light-weight objects created by connections.
 *
 * Connections are the parent objects of transactions.
 * Connections own the transaction objects.
 * 
 * Transactions store nearly all their state in the parent connection object.
 * This reduces the memory requirements for transactions objects,
 * and reduces the overhead associated in creating them.

/**
 * Under normal circumstances, when a read-write transaction block completes,
 * the changes are automatically committed. If, however, something goes wrong and
 * you'd like to abort and discard all changes made within the transaction,
 * then invoke this method.
 * 
 * You should generally return (exit the transaction block) after invoking this method.
 * Any changes made within the the transaction before and after invoking this method will be discarded.
 *
 * Invoking this method from within a read-only transaction does nothing.

/**
 * The YapDatabaseModifiedNotification is posted following a readwrite transaction which made changes.
 * 
 * These notifications are used in a variety of ways:
 * - They may be used as a general notification mechanism to detect changes to the database.
 * - They may be used by extensions to post change information.
 *   For example, YapDatabaseView will post the index changes, which can easily be used to animate a tableView.
 * - They are integrated into the architecture of long-lived transactions in order to maintain a steady state.
 *
 * Thus it is recommended you integrate your own notification information into this existing notification,
 * as opposed to broadcasting your own separate notification.
 *
 * Invoking this method from within a read-only transaction does nothing.
