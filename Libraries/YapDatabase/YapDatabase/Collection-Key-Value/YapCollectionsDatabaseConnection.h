/**
 * A connection provides a point of access to the database.
 *
 * You first create and configure a YapCollectionsDatabase instance.
 * Then you can spawn one or more connections to the database file.
 *
 * Multiple connections can simultaneously read from the database.
 * Multiple connections can simultaneously read from the database while another connection is modifying the database.
 * For example, the main thread could be reading from the database via connection A,
 * while a background thread is writing to the database via connection B.
 *
 * However, only a single connection may be writing to the database at any one time.
 *
 * A connection instance is thread-safe, and operates by serializing access to itself.
 * Thus you can share a single connection between multiple threads.
 * But for conncurrent access between multiple threads you must use multiple connections.
